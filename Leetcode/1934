-- Second way
select s.user_id , round(sum(if(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0))/count(*), 2) as confirmation_rate
from Signups s left join Confirmations c
on s.user_id = c.user_id
group by s.user_id


# Note:
# I can also use like sum(c.action = 'confirmed') directly. but in this way, if c.action = null, then sum will also return null. Then I need to handle that null values seperately.

# count(*) returns 1 even if row contains null value, but count(c.action) returns 0 if its value is null for that row.
