-- # Subquery method

select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee
where salary !=
(select max(salary)
from Employee)

--  Time Complexity:
--     Inner query SELECT MAX(salary): O(n)
--     Outer query: MAX(salary) over filtered list: O(n)
--  Total: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)


-- # Offset Method

-- select
-- (select distinct salary 
-- from Employee
-- order by salary desc
-- limit 1 offset 1) as SecondHighestSalary 

--  Time Complexity:
--     DISTINCT salary: O(n) — has to scan all salaries.
--     ORDER BY salary DESC: O(n log n) — sorting.
--     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1: O(1) — after sort, it picks second.
--  Total: O(n log n)
